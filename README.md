New Seurat user
Hi, I am a new seurat user with no coding experience. I am trying to do Data Integration using seurat Seurat_4.0.1. I was able to load the Seurat library earlier. But after I install packages "SeuratData" and "patchwork", the Seurat can not be loaded. It came with this error message: "Error: package or namespace load failed for ‘Seurat’ in loadNamespace(i, c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[i]]): namespace ‘spatstat.utils’ 2.0-0 is already loaded, but >= 2.1.0 is required". 
Can anyone help me to solve this? Many Thanks!
